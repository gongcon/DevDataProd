Exploratory Analysis
========================================================

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(supp, len, data=ToothGrowth, main="Different Supplements", xlab="Supplement", ylab="Tooth Length", geom="boxplot", colour=I("blue")) + facet_wrap( ~ dose) + theme_bw(base_size = 10, base_family = "Helvetica")
```
***
- For doses of .5 and 1.0 mg, there seems to be a relatively large difference between the supplements.
- For doses of 2.0 mg, however, there doesnâ€™t seem to be much difference between the supplements.


Exploratory Analysis
========================================================

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(as.factor(dose), len, data=ToothGrowth, main="Different Doses", xlab="Dose", ylab="Tooth Length", geom="boxplot", colour=I("blue")) + facet_wrap( ~ supp) + theme_bw(base_size = 10, base_family = "Helvetica")
```
***
- For Vitamin C supplement, there seems to be large difference between the doses.
- For Orange Juice supplement, dose 1.0 and 2.0 seems to be close.

Confidence Intervals And Hypothesis Tests
========================================================

- Compare the two groups of supplyments with dose 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, respectively.
  * Only with dose 2.0, p-value > 0.05 and confident interval contains 0.
- Compare the three doses each others in different group of supplyments.
  * No supplement and dose pair in the test derive p-value > 0.05 and confident interval contains 0.

Conclution
========================================================

- With dose 0.5 and 1.0, the two supplement types do not have same effect to the tooth growth. 
- With more dose, 2.0, the two supp types have same effect to the tooth growth.
- With supplement type Vitamic C, all doses have different effect.
